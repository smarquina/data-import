## About Data import

This project is a sample about jobs & queues to import a huge amount of products using CSV files.

Queues can be configured in environment file. Possible queue drivers are DB and Redis (used DB by default).

##  Steps to get project running ðŸ› 

1. Create `.env` file: copy or rename `.env.example` located in project root folder. Run `php artisan key:generate` 
to generate a new application key.

2. Install dependencies: to install all app dependencies, run `composer install`.
If you will modify styles or JS, you'll need also npm modules installed. Run `npm i` to install al packages dependencies.

3. Setup database: create the database on your system and set corresponding connection parameters in the `.env` file.

4. migrate & seed: to generate migrations run command `php artisan migrate`. Then run seeds with `php artisan db:seed`.

5. start queue workers:

    <ins>If application runs under Windows system:</ins>
    
    Run `START /b php artisan queue:work --timeout=0` to start processing queue in background.
    
    <ins>If application runs under Unix system:</ins>
    
    Run ``nohup php artisan queue:work --timeout=0 &`` to start processing queue in background.

## Running project ðŸš€

To serve the app on to a virtual dev server, run `php artisan serve` and app will start. 
You can find the url address in the response if this command.

You can simply generate a random products file with whe generation button of the index card header.

Before uploading a CSV make sure queue is running. If not Job will be generated but bot imported.
([Laravel queues](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/queues)).
